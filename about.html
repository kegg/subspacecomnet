          <p>SUBSPACE COM NET is a collection of Star Trek stories that I have
            written over the years. These stories take place aboard the U.S.S.
            Fresno.</p>

            <p>Star Trek: Fresno takes place in a universe very similar to the
              one that we see on the shows every week. At first when I started
              the series I thought about making every story take place in a
              different universe, but later changed that idea. If I were to do
              that there would be no room for improvement and growth for my
              characters. So I canned that idea and started a new Series Opener.
              I still have the two stories that I wrote in the different
              universes on my website, but they are just there. Those two
              stories don't have anything to do with the current series. The
              first pilot The Hatred the Burns within. ended in a way that
              really wouldn't allow for growth. And the second 'episode' was a
              story I wrote for an English Class my 12th grade year in High
              School titled A Man With a Heart of Oak, (which I got an A on by
              the way). There is a third story to the Star Trek: Fresno series
              titled Infiltration and a fourth titled Waiting For Death. They
              would have been a three part story arc. I didn't like where it
              was heading, it was a little too dark for me so I decided not to
              continue on with that project.</p>

              <p>The new Star Trek: Fresno starts with the episode The
                Underground, Section 31. Now I have room for growth, my
                website has a new look to it for the series and I have added
                several other things including crew bios (which I will update
                as the series progresses). So my characters will grow, instead
                of dying after each story (which I agree would get boring after
                about doing it twice.)</p>
